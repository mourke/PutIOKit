/**
 This class provides helper methods for authenticating users against the @b Put.io authentication service. In order to make any calls to the api this class must first be configured.
 
    0. Set your `apiSecret`, `clientID` and `redirectURI` obtained when registering for a new @b Put.io account. (https://app.put.io/oauth/apps/new).
    1. Register your application for the URL Scheme that is in your `redirectURI`.
    2. Add yourself as a listener to the `PIOAuthenticatorDelegate` by calling `addListener:`.
    3. Open the `signInURL` variable in some webview - `SFSafariViewController`, `Safari`, `WKWebView` etc.
    4. Pass the 'code' received from this URL into the `getCredentialForCode:callback:` method.
    5. Done! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. The credential will have been stored in the user's keychain for later use.
 
 @note If you want to use this class for storing credentials, - which it will do automatically - you must have keychain accessibilty turned on in your app's capabilities page.
